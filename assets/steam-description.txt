[h1]Overview[/h1]
This mod is a compatibility patch between [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2962066593]Specialist Subject: Mercatorum[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2183551683]Vassals Expanded and Reworked - FunEFork[/url].  Because Vassals Expanded and Reworked offers individual resource subsidy sliders, this version of a Mercatorum uses those instead of a workaround to implement its restrictions for commercial/infrastructure subsidies.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Largely plays the same as Specialist Subject: Mercatorum, with additional compatibility for the addition agreement terms added by Vassals Expanded and Reworked: Ruler Designation, Government Restructuring, Domestic Affairs, Naming Rights, and Capital Relocation. Two custom agreement terms from Specialist Subject: Mercatorum have been removed (Monthly Commercial Dividends, Monthly Infrastructure Subsidies) in favor of the single resource sliders implemented by Vassals Expanded and Reworked.

Some code from Vassals Expanded and Reworked has been overridden in order to add the relevant restrictions for Mercatora.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor." Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added to your savegame after the game has started. Because it adds gameplay objects (most notably things related to the Mercatorum subject specialization), it should not be removed during a game.

Overriding many types of game objects causes the game to log errors noting each override. Expect to see thirty-one (!) lines in the error.log file, mostly related to overwriting agreement term values and agreement terms.
